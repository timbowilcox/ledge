# Template Reference

Ledge ships with 8 business templates. Each template provides a pre-configured chart of accounts, default currency, and accounting basis.

## How Templates Work

- **Apply once**: Templates create accounts in a ledger. They can only be applied once per ledger.
- **Accounts are permanent**: Once created, template accounts cannot be removed (but you can add more).
- **Recommendation engine**: POST `/v1/templates/recommend` scores your business description against all templates using keyword matching (primary keywords weight 3, secondary weight 1).

## Account Code Convention

All templates follow the same numbering scheme:

| Code Range | Account Type |
|------------|-------------|
| 1000–1099 | Cash & equivalents |
| 1100–1499 | Current assets |
| 1500–1999 | Non-current assets |
| 2000–2499 | Current liabilities |
| 2500–2999 | Non-current liabilities |
| 3000–3999 | Equity |
| 4000–4999 | Revenue |
| 5000–5999 | Cost of revenue / COGS |
| 6000–6999 | Operating expenses |
