### Three Core Workflows

1. **Create Invoice** — When you invoice a client, the app posts a journal entry that debits Accounts Receivable and credits Consulting Fees. Revenue is recognized immediately.

2. **Record Payment** — When a client pays, the app debits Cash and credits Accounts Receivable. Your AR balance goes down, cash goes up.

3. **Record Expense** — When you spend money (subcontractors, travel, software, etc.), the app debits the appropriate expense account and credits Cash.

Every action is a proper double-entry journal entry. The P&L and Balance Sheet update automatically.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

cd examples/invoice-manager

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Seed the ledger with sample data
pnpm seed
# → Copy the LEDGE_LEDGER_ID and LEDGE_API_KEY into .env

# Start the dev server
pnpm dev
```

## Extending This Example

- Add invoice numbering with auto-increment
- Track individual invoices with metadata and link payments to specific invoices
- Add expense receipt uploads using Ledge transaction metadata
- Build an aging report for outstanding receivables
- Add tax calculation and withholding (debit expense, credit Tax Liabilities)
- Generate PDF invoices from transaction data
