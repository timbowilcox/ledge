## Architecture

Monorepo powered by Turborepo:

```
packages/
  core/       # @kounta/core — Double-entry engine, domain logic
  api/        # @kounta/api — REST API (Hono, 80+ endpoints)
  mcp/        # @kounta/mcp — MCP server (55 tools)
  sdk/        # @kounta/sdk — TypeScript client SDK (17 modules)
  dashboard/  # @kounta/dashboard — Next.js dashboard
```

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** (strict mode)
- **PostgreSQL** (production) / **SQLite** (self-hosted)
- **Hono** — API framework
- **Zod** — validation (shared across API, SDK, and MCP)
- **Next.js** — dashboard
- **Turborepo** — monorepo orchestration

## Quick Start

### Use the hosted API

```typescript
import { Kounta } from "@kounta/sdk";

const kounta = new Kounta({
  apiKey: "kounta_live_...",
  baseUrl: "https://api.kounta.ai",
});

// Create accounts
await kounta.accounts.create(ledgerId, {
  code: "1000", name: "Cash", type: "asset",
});

// Post a transaction
await kounta.transactions.post(ledgerId, {
  date: "2026-03-14",
  memo: "Monthly subscription",
  lines: [
    { accountCode: "1000", amount: 4999, direction: "debit" },
    { accountCode: "4000", amount: 4999, direction: "credit" },
  ],
});

// Generate financial statements
const pnl = await kounta.reports.incomeStatement(ledgerId, "2026-01-01", "2026-03-31");
```

### Connect AI assistant via MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kounta": {
      "url": "https://mcp.kounta.ai/sse?key=YOUR_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

### Self-host with Docker

```bash
docker run -p 3001:3001 kounta/kounta
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm install          # install dependencies
pnpm dev              # start all packages in dev mode
pnpm build            # build all packages
pnpm test             # run tests across all packages
pnpm lint             # lint all packages
pnpm typecheck        # type-check all packages
```

## Core Invariants

- Debits always equal credits (enforced at the database level)
- Transactions are immutable (reversals create new entries)
- Amounts are integers in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents)
- All IDs are UUID v7
- All timestamps are UTC ISO 8601
- API keys stored as SHA-256 hashes (shown once at creation)
